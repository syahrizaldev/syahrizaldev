# Hello Everyone...

My name is Syahrizal, a Web **Designer and Developer** based in Indonesia who specializes mostly in **Front-End Development** with more than five years of experience. I am very enthusiastic about **design and building responsive, interactive, and user-friendly website or web applications** that work properly. I focused on writing accessible **HTML5, using modern CSS3 (Including Sass, Flexbox, Grid), and writing clean JavaScript code**.

Besides, I am also practicing some of popular Front-End User Interface (UI) Kits like **Bootstrap, Materialize, and TailwindCSS** to supporting me in developing some of my works. Now, I'm currently attempted to increase my Web Development skills by learning and practicing some of powerful and useful technologies such as **Node, React, Vue, and MongoDB**.
