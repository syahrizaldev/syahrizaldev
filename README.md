# Hello World! I am Web Designer & Developer.

> My name is Syahrizal. a Web **Designer** and **Developer** based in Indonesia who specializes in mostly **Front-end Development** with more than five years of experience.
I am very enthusiastic on design and build a responsive website that works properly and user-friendly. I focused on writing accessible **HTML**, using modern **SASS** (the CSS pre compiler), and writing clean **JavaScript** code.

> Besides, I am also practicing some of popular Front-end Web UI Kits like **Bootstrap, Materialize, UIKit, Bulma, and TailwindCSS** for supporting me in developing some of my project works.
Now, I am currently attempted to increase my Web Development skills by learning some awesome and useful technologies such as **Node, React, and Vue**.
